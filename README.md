# DevOps-Pipeline-sweng
![](https://travis-ci.com/christophernixon/DevOps-Pipeline-sweng.svg?branch=develop)

A project aimed at implementing a CI/CD pipeline for a simple reactJS application.

Within this project is a React-JS application of a simple map-based quiz app, and the surrounding scripts and configuration files for a complete CI/CD pipeline. The pipeline is orchestrated with Travis CI, uses Jest and Cypress for testing and deploys to multiple IBM cloud kubernetes services.

User/Developer/Administrator guides can be found on [Github Pages](https://christophernixon.github.io/DevOps-Pipeline-sweng/).

These guides detail how a User would use our front end application, how one would install the project locally and how administrators would manage the main operations of the pipeline.
